# Generate images for sharing Stellar Quests results

An image will be generated and returned when calling the cloudflare worker endpoint.


## 🔋 Getting Started

This worker is meant to be used with [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). If you are not already familiar with the tool, we recommend that you install the tool and configure it to work with your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com). Documentation can be found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/).


1. Install wrangler - `yarn global add @cloudflare/wrangler`
2. Install node modules - `yarn`
3. Create a build - `yarn build`
4. Run Wrangler Dev - `yarn start`

### 👩 💻 Developing

[`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) calls the request handler in [`src/handler.ts`](./src/handler.ts), and will return the [request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method) for the given request.

### 🧪 Testing

This template comes with jest tests which simply test that the request handler can handle each request method. `yarn test` will run your tests.

### ✏️ Formatting

This template uses [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to format the project. To invoke, run `yarn format`.

### 👀 Previewing and Publishing

For information on how to preview and publish your worker, please see the [Wrangler docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/commands/#publish).
